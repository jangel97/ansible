bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Temporary executables are now verified as executable after creation.
                   Without this check, path injected scripts may not be found,
                   typically on systems with ``/tmp`` mounted using the "noexec" option.
                   This can manifest as a missing Python interpreter, or use of the wrong Python interpreter, as well
                   as other error conditions.
