bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Test containers are now run with the ``--tmpfs`` option for ``/tmp``, ``/run`` and ``/run/lock``.
                   This allows use of containers built without the ``VOLUME`` instruction.
                   Additionally, containers with those volumes defined no longer create anonymous volumes for them.
                   This avoids leaving behind volumes on the container host after the container is stopped and deleted.
